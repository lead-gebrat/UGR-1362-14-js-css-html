          <p class="favorites__book-card__review__para">Seems like ages since I've been captivated by a book as  much as this. I haven't read in one sitting for a long time.
            Despite having an unfamiliar structure... This book was mesmerizing begining to end. The plot was undeniably astonishing. Pacing was nicely maintained felt like this was a short story.
            The focus on the despair of the characters was what made the book amazing. Gave it its emotion connection. By that I mean I cried. camon camon.. Why kill the kid why??
            It was a great recommendation koloss. I am grateful.
            This is a hidden gem.</p>

          <p class="favorites__book-card__review__para">"She needs me, but I can't come, because I'm afraid—so terribly afraid—that my hands are filthy with her mother's blood."
            ...
            "Would they have someone wash her hair? he asked. She washed it last on Monday night, and so it had been dirty when she died"
            ...
            "Hey, police? I just saw the world's oldest, slowest kid climbing into Pleasantview Cemetery. Looked like he was dying to get in. Yeah, looked like a grave matter to me. Kidding? Oh no, I'm in dead earnest. Maybe you ought to dig into it."
            ...
            
            I don't even know what to say man. This was a horrible horrible nightmare. This is once and for all the best book I have ever read of Stephen King. Boy does he have his way with words.
            I do not like horror anything. I stray away from it. I love to avoid it. But I have never read a book as willingly as I have read this. You hope and you hope for it to end...but it's like bitting into your wound over and over again because this time it'll definitely feel better. What's even more scarier about it is how human it is, how real it feels. You see how each and every decision was made, how complex the thought process was, how beautifully painful grief is, and how low you would go to see that face again. You don't just read this book... you live it.
            I now have the utmost respect for Stephen King. This is a book I will never ever read again. No wonder he put it in that drawer.</p>

            She IS Brave. 
            I love how this story never ceases to scare me no matter how many times I hear it. Although, this time, Neil Gaiman's voice  was a huge contributor(audio book - highly recommended).
            "And, after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see." 
            "It is astonishing just how much of what we are can be tied to the beds we wake up in in the morning, and it is astonishing how fragile that can be." "The sky had never seemed so sky; the world had never seemed so world."-words have never made more sense. 
            I loved it.

            2 books and I'm just beginning to understand how the world works... Storms! 2 more books to go and hopefully I will know my order(I hope I'm awesome! ) That is If the everstorm doesn't doom us all... a mystery yet to be solved.</p>
